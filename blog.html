        <p class="mt-12">A blog (a truncation of "weblog")[1] is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting <br> of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological ord <br> er, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work <br> of a single individual,[citation needed] occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject <br> or topic. In the 2010s, "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally edited. <br> MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing <br> quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into <br> the news media. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.</p>
        <p class="mt-12">The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the <br> posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or computer programming. Previously, a knowledge of such <br> technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been required to publish content on the Web, and early Web users <br> therefore tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts. In the 2010s, the majority are interactive Web 2.0 websites, <br> allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites.[2] In that sense, blogging can be seen <br> as a form of social networking service. Indeed, bloggers not only produce content to post on their blogs but also <br> often build social relations with their readers and other bloggers.[3] However, there are high-readership blogs which do not allow comments.</p>
